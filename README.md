# Clicky Game!

## Description

Test your memory with a dog-lover clicky game using React. When the page loads, 12 differnt images of dogs will appear. Click an image more than once, and the game will start over.

## Instructions

    1. On the page load, the app will render different images of dogs. Each image will listen for click events.
    2. The app will keep track of the user's score. The score will be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score will reset to zero if they click the same image more than once.
    3. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game will restart.
    4. Time to jog your memory!
